description: Code quality standards for writing and reviewing code
---

- Functions do ONE thing, kept short (<30 lines)
- Follow SOLID principles
- No comments unless logic is non-obvious
- No dead code, commented-out blocks, or debug leftovers
- Names reveal intent — no cryptic abbreviations
- Match existing codebase patterns and conventions
- No features beyond what was asked
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No unnecessary error handling for impossible scenarios
